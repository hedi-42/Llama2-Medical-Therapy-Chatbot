## **How to Run the Project**  

### **Step 1: Serve the PDF Files**  
Navigate to the `data` folder and serve the PDFs using Python's HTTP server:  
    ```
    cd data
    python -m http.server 8001
    ```

### **Step 2: Process the Medical Documents**  
Go back to the project root folder and run the ingestion script to create the vector database:  
    ```
    cd ..
    python ingest.py
    ```

### **Step 3: Start the Chatbot**  
Run the chatbot with Chainlit:  
    ```
    chainlit run model.py -w
    ```

## **Notes**  
- Ensure the `data` folder contains relevant PDFs before running the ingestion script.  
- The chatbot runs locally, so no data is sent to external servers.  
- For questions or contributions, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
